# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I have completed this [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. I have taken some liberty to make changes to my liking.
You can find the content related to this challenge on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website. I am also using [Modern reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) and the type scale from [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/).

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
